        <li>Black holes are regions in space where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape.</li>
        <li>They are formed when massive stars collapse under their own gravity at the end of their life cycle.</li>
        <li>The point of no return around a black hole is called the event horizon.</li>
        <li>Supermassive black holes, with millions or billions of times the mass of the Sun, exist at the centers of most galaxies.</li>
        <li>Black holes can be detected by observing their effects on nearby matter, like the orbits of stars or the emission of X-rays. </li>
